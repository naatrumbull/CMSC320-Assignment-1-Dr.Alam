Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git helps its users to manage code and data changes and is particulary
effective when working with a team. Git gives you the option to push code to a
remote repository and serves a good way to back up code. Git also allows you to use
branches which allows you add new elements to your code without the risk of messing up your
functioning code. Using branches also allows you to create a version control system which lets
you see the gradual development of your code as you wrote it.
