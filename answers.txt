Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git helps its users to manage code and data changes and is particulary
effective when working with a team. Git gives you the option to push code to a
remote repository and serves a good way to back up code. Git also allows you to use
branches which allows you add new elements to your code without the risk of messing up your
functioning code. Using branches also allows you to create a version control system which lets
you see the gradual development of your code as you wrote it.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). All types of Artificial Intelliegence relies
on vast data sets. Having a large and diverse set of data for ai models to sample is important
for improving AI models so that that they can function as they are intended to. For example, an AI model that detects and identifies different
types of plants should have large data sets for all different of types of plants. It may needs photos of those plants in different stages of its
life, as well as in all angles and lightning conditions in order for the plant to be properly identified by the model. 


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Rebasing and merging both have to do with reorganizing branches. With rebasing, you are moving the base of your branches
to appear as if you made the branch from a different commit than you had. This is done by creating new commits to the base and applying them to
the base. Merging, on the other hand, is the processing of applying the contents of one branch to another. Usually, this is taking 
the contents of a lower branch and moving them up to a higher branch.
