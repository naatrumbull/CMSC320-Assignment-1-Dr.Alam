Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). All types of Artificial Intelliegence relies
on vast data sets. Having a large and diverse set of data for ai models to sample is important
for improving AI models so that that they can function as they are intended to. For example, an AI model that detects and identifies different
types of plants should have large data sets for all different of types of plants. It may needs photos of those plants in different stages of its
life, as well as in all angles and lightning conditions in order for the plant to be properly identified by the model.
